Here are the rules:

    1) Select a player to start the game.
    2) Collect a heart, star or key will give you 10 points each
    3) Collect a gem (blue, green or orange) will give you 30 points each 
    (Watch out! They disappear after a while.)
    4) Collect a meteor will give you 50 points (but once it starts sliding down its gone.)
    5) Be careful with the bugs! Avoid colliding with them or the game is over.
    6) If you make to the water line you will get 20 points and can continue collecting more items.
