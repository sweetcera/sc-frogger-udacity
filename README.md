This is a copy cat Frogger game for the Project: Classic Arcade Game Clone classes, part of the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree.

How To Play:

1) Use your mouse to click to select a player to start the game.
2) Use your keyboard arrows to move your player.

Here are the rules:

1) Collect a heart, star or key will give you 10 points each
2) Collect a gem (blue, green or orange) will give you 30 points each 
(Watch out! They disappear after a while.)
3) Collect a meteor will give you 50 points (but once it starts sliding down its gone.)
4) Be careful with the bugs! Avoid colliding with them or the game is over.
5) If you make to the water line you will get 20 points and can continue collecting more items.
